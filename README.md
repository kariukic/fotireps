### FOTIREPS - Friends of The Ionosphere, RTS EoR Processing Suite.

Fotireps is now a user-friendly MWA EoR data processing suite made from a conglomerate of different tools used by the MWA EoR group.

It was originally started as a tool for ionospheric analysis,hence the title.

Fotireps is highly modularized with each step being runnable in isolation but can also perform standard end to end EoR analysis on MWA observations.

The key tasks included are:
1. Data selection (Custom made functionality based on MWA ASVO and web services).
2. Flagging (COTTER).
3. DI and DD calibration (RTS, sourcelist_by_beam, ...).
4. Ionospheric analysis (CTHULHU, OI, ...).
5. Power spectrum estimation and plotting (CHIPS, plotting).
